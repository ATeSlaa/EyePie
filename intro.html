			<h1>Pie Spot Light: Celebration, Florida</h1>
					<p>For the tenth year in a row, the town of Celebration, Florida will become the Pie Capital of the World April 9th and 10th when thousands of pie lovers, tasters and bakers gather together the Great American Pie Festival sponsored by Crisco®. The highlight, as always, will be the Never-Ending Pie Buffet, featuring award-winning pie, ice cream, toppings and beverages from some of our fine sponsors!</p>

					<p>This year, pie lovers from across the country will be treated to sweet offerings by Bakers Square Restaurants and Pies, Bonert’s Slice of Pie, California Raisin Marketing Board, J. Horner’s Desserts, Kroger’s Private Selection, Publix Super Markets, Inc., Rocky Mountain Pies, Smucker’s Toppings, The Folger Coffee Company, Village Inn and Wick’s Pies.</p>

					<p>Thousands of children will make their own pies at the Crisco Kids Creation Station. There will be pie decorating, pie scaping, pie tin art and many more pie activities to enjoy. <q>This is the most fun thing ever!</q> says 12 year old, Anthony Hill from PCB, FL. The Pietopia Demonstration Stage sponsored by Village Inn and Bakers Square Restaurants featured entertainment and baking demonstration by chefs from across the country. Of course, no pie festival would be complete without a Pie Eating Contest, sponsored by Private Selection.</p>
